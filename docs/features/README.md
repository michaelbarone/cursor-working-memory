# features

Document features here for the agent to refernece.  Have the agent help document existing features by using the following prompts:

For a specific feature:

```terminal
Help me document XYZ feature in the @/docs/features directory
```

For all features (may take several attempts):

```terminal
Help me document all our application features in the @/docs/features directory
```

You will want to verify and correct or further clarify any areas.  The agent will use this later when working with features so it helps to be extremely clear with specific and specialized functionality.
