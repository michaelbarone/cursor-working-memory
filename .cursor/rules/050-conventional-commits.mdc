name: conventional_commits
description: Automatically commit changes made by CursorAI using conventional commits format with support for breaking changes, multiple scopes, and detailed descriptions

  - type: event
    pattern: "build_success"

    message: |
      Changes should be committed using conventional commits format:

      Format: <type>(<scope>): <description>
             [BREAKING CHANGE: <breaking change description>]
             [<body>]
             [<footer>]

      Types:
      - feat: ✨ A new feature
      - fix: 🐛 A bug fix
      - hotfix: 🔥 Hotfix Required
      - docs: 📚 Documentation only changes
      - plan: 📚 Plan only changes
      - style: 💎 Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
      - refactor: 📦 A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
      - perf: 🚀 A code change that improves performance
      - test: 🚨 Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
      - build: 🛠 Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies
      - ci: ⚙️ Changes to CI configuration files and scripts
      - chore: ♻️ Other changes that don't modify src or test files
      - revert: 🗑 Reverts a previous commit
      - rule: 📜 Changes to .cursor/rules files

      Scope:
      - Can be multiple, comma-separated
      - Derived from file path and content
      - Optional if no specific scope applies

      Breaking Changes:
      - ALWAYS confirm with the user before adding "BREAKING CHANGE:" to commits
      - Ask explicitly: "This change appears to be breaking. Should I include a BREAKING CHANGE notice in the commit message?"
      - If confirmed, add "BREAKING CHANGE:" in the description
      - Include clear explanation of what breaks and how to update
      - Example confirmation:
        ```
        This change modifies the authentication API interface.
        This appears to be a breaking change because:
        - It removes the legacy authentication method
        - It requires updating client configurations

        Would you like me to include a BREAKING CHANGE notice in the commit?
        ```

      Body and Footer:
      - Body: Detailed description of the change
      - Footer: References to issues (e.g., "Closes #123")

      ## Commit Message Patterns

      1. Simple Single-Line (Most Reliable):
      ```powershell
      # PowerShell
      git commit -m "feat(ui): add new button component"
      ```
      ```bash
      # Bash
      git commit -m "feat(ui): add new button component"
      ```

      2. Two-Part Message (Recommended):
      ```powershell
      # PowerShell - Using array for multiple messages
      git commit -m "feat(rules): update conventional commits rule" -m "- Optimize PowerShell commit message formatting"
      ```
      ```bash
      # Bash
      git commit -m "feat(ui): add new dashboard components" \
                -m "Implements metric cards and responsive layout"
      ```

      3. Multi-line Message (For Complex Changes):
      ```powershell
      # PowerShell - Using array join for reliable multi-line (recommended)
      git commit -m "feat(rules): update conventional commits rule" -m "- Optimize PowerShell commit message formatting`n- Add error handling for commit operations`n- Improve documentation for multi-line commits`n- Update examples with PowerShell best practices`n`nBREAKING CHANGE: Requires PowerShell 5.1+"
      ```
      ```bash
      # Bash - Using heredoc
      git commit -m "$(cat << 'EOF'
feat(auth): implement OAuth2 authentication

- Add OAuth2 provider integration
- Update middleware

BREAKING CHANGE: New authentication flow requires client update
EOF
      )"
      ```

      ## Best Practices

      1. Message Structure:
         - Keep messages clear and concise
         - Use imperative mood ("add" not "added")
         - Separate subject from body with blank line
         - Limit subject line to 50 characters
         - Wrap body at 72 characters

      2. Reliable Approaches (in order of preference):
         - Single -m parameter for simple changes
         - Array-based approach for multiple messages
         - Array join for complex multi-line messages
         - Here-string only when necessary (beware of indentation)

      4. Breaking Changes:
         ```powershell
         # PowerShell - Using array join for reliable formatting
         git commit -m "feat(rules): update conventional commits rule" -m "- Optimize PowerShell commit message formatting`n- Add error handling for commit operations`n- Improve documentation for multi-line commits`n- Update examples with PowerShell best practices`n`nBREAKING CHANGE: Requires PowerShell 5.1+"
         ```
         ```bash
         # Bash
         git commit -m "$(cat << 'EOF'
feat(auth): implement new authentication system

- Add OAuth2 provider integration
- Remove legacy authentication
- Update middleware

BREAKING CHANGE: Legacy authentication removed.
Update client configurations to use OAuth2.
