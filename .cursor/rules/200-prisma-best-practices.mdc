      Follow these Prisma best practices:

      1. Schema Design:
         - Use meaningful model and field names
         - Include proper indexes for frequently queried fields
         - Define explicit relations between models
         - Use appropriate field types and modifiers

      2. Client Usage:
         - Use transactions for related operations
         - Implement proper error handling
         - Optimize queries using include/select
         - Use middleware for cross-cutting concerns

      3. Performance:
         - Add indexes for frequently queried fields
         - Use batch operations when possible
         - Implement proper connection pooling
         - Monitor query performance

examples:
  - input: |
      model User {
        id Int @id @default(autoincrement())
        email String @unique
        posts Post[]
      }
    output: "Valid Prisma model definition"

  - input: |
      model post {
        Id Int @id
      }
    output: "Invalid: Model name should be PascalCase"
